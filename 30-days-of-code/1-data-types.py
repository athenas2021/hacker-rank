# Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
# Use the  operator to perform the following operations:
# Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
# Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
# Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
